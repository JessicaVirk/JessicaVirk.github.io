    <p> My name is Jessica Virk and I am a senior at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. My CTE course, Web Design, 
        allows me to delve deeper in the topics of coding to create different types of web pages! You can keep up
        with my portfolio to see all the projects I have been working on! </p>
