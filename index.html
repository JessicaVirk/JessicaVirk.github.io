    <p> My name is Jessica Virk and I am a senior at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. My CTE course, Web Design, 
        allows me to delve deeper in the topics of coding to create different types of web pages! You can keep up
        with my portfolio to see all the projects I have been working on! </p>

<a href="https://jessicavirk.github.io/Which-Harry-Potter-Character-Are-You-1/."> Character Quiz </a>

<p> In this project, our task was to create a short quiz that would give the quiz taker a specific answer based on the choices they chose. 
    Our requirements were to have a series of questions with more than one answer choice which would result in more than one answer. Specifcally,
     I chose the topic of "Which Harry Potter Character Are You?" I provided a series of questions that can have more than one response and gave the
     quiz taker up to four characters they can be chosen as. In the code, we had to use various features ranging from the click function all the way to 
    numberous else if statements.</p>

                                                    <p> In this project, our task was to create a series of images with an input box, allowing the user 
                                                                                         to input an image link for it to be shown on the page. I was able to use
                                                                                         different CSS styles and expolor various HTML functions and imrpoved in such things
                                                                                         as the click function and really understood the purpose of codes such as the (val) method.
                                                                                      </p>
